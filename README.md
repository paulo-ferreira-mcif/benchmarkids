# BenchmarkIDS

Java CLI application to benchmark IDS dataset.

This is the supporting application of my MSc dissertation on benchmarking IDS using bio-inspired algorithms.

It's a very specific application, mainly aimed at automating the specific tests used on my dissertation.

Still, itÂ´s a nice example on how to use WEKA's Java API.

Uses Weka API and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset
